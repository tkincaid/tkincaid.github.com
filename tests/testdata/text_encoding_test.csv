"ffffc4f85b60efc5b52347df489d0238","I am a fourth year fifth grade math teacher. The school I teach in is a fifth and sixth grade public school and is a Title One school which means that 95% of our students get free lunch. Presently, I am in the process of completing a Masters degree in Technology in Education through Lesley University. My coursework through Lesley University is allowing me to continue to be a lifelong learner and allow my students to learn in an environment that they can be successful in. Technology has a huge impact on my students' involvement in the classroom. I would like the opportunity to introduce more technology in the classroom, but I need the help of wonderful people like you. \n\nI would like to introduce to my students the program I call iMath. Through the iMath program I would integrate iPods into my math curriculum. It would allow students to practice their math facts, construct projects, create podcasts, listen to tests, and review lessons. iPods would allow my students to learn on their own, with other classmates, or with the entire class. Having iPods in the classroom would not only encourage students to get excited about learning math, it would also make it easier for me to accommodate students who have special needs. This includes having tests read aloud to them or reviewing the day’s lesson played back on the iPod. \n\nStudents continue to struggle with learning their basic facts. As a teacher, I have tried many different ways to help them learn, including using food, manipulatives, and flash cards. I would like to now venture out and try using innovative technology which is what students use every day. Students are used to playing video games and having technology at their finger tips. Unfortunately, I work in a Title One School and don’t have the funds to purchase the desired technology. With your help I could get the technology needed to change my students' minds about how they feel about math. \n\nIt is imperative that teachers bring technology into the classroom, if students are going to be able to survive in the 21st Century. The classroom needs to be ever changing along with the outside world. The iMath project will help students by obtaining classroom subject proficiency through a wide variety of learning methods while using the iPods. According to an Article in iLearn called 21st Century Literacy, “students learn best when they build critical thinking and problem solving skills instead of memorization.” I want to create a 21st century classroom where students learn to become lifelong learners. Your help will help me reach my goals and my students goals.","f"
"ffffac55ee02a49d1abc87ba6fc61135","Can you imagine having to translate everything you read into sign language and relate it to what you already know? Help us do just that by giving us the camera that will record our stories and interpretations! \n\nMy students are all deaf or hard of hearing who are struggling to master reading and language skills at the same time.  My students have varying levels of benefit from hearing aids or cochlear implants, and they are all using sign language either for language support or for full communication. In addition to being deaf, my students are also in a Title 1 school in a Title 1 county. \n\nThis easy to use video camera will help our students to support reading by helping us record translations of the stories, real life items, and sign language interpretations.  The video element will help support reading and language skills in a form that my students can more easily relate to and learn from. \n\nDonations to this project will be extremely beneficial to supporting students with language deficits.  My students will be able to use technology to support learning in a different way and connect with the world they know.  Thank you! ","f"
"ffff97ed93720407d70a2787475932b0","Hi. I teach a wonderful group of 4-5 year old Kindergarten students.  They come in wanting and willing to learn new and exciting things each and every day. I work hard to ensure that my students get the most out of the entire school year. \n\nFor the most part, this is the first academic experiences my students have.  That's why it is vitally important to ensure that they keep the excitement and joy for learning throughout the entire school year and take it with them to first grade.  To ensure this happens, there are certain supplies that every classroom needs. \n\nUnfortunately, with past and present budget cuts, supplies are not readily available.  This makes it increasingly difficult to ensure that my students can continue to be productive and excited about learning day after day.  Chart tablets and markers to write out experience charts, sentence strips for activities and bulletin boards, crayons for art and learning, safety tags for field trips and an electric sharpener will allow my students enjoy learning each and every day. \n\nPlease, I know it takes a special person to donate to a group of children they don't know, especially in these hard economic times, but my students are worth it.  They deserve to have the proper supplies to ensure that their long education gets off to the right start. ","f"
"ffff7266778f71242675416e600b94e1","My Kindergarten students come from a variety of backgrounds. As their teacher, it is my duty to provide a wide variety of texts as we begin to learn how to read. \n\nKindergarten students are excited about school - especially about learning to read. I hope to feed their excitement by introducing new types of text, and different reasons for learning. Learning to read non-fiction text is often a struggle for beginning readers, but ""Let's Find Out"" magazine makes it fun. \n\n""Let's Find Out"" is an awesome magazine that keeps students entertained with colorful thematic stories presented at age-appropriate levels. The simple, repetitive text will introduce our students to important early reading skills. The magazines also include posters to use in our classroom. \n\nYour generous donation will help a wonderful group of Kindergarten students read and enjoy non-fiction texts. As a teacher, it is my job to empower students by giving them the tools needed to become successful lifelong learners. With your donation, you are taking part in this wonderful process. ","f"
"ffff418bb42fad24347527ad96100f81","All work and no play makes school a dull place to learn. Our class is a 4th grade general education classroom. \n\nIn an effort to go green our district has cut WAY down on the number of copies that can be made.  This makes it very difficult to accurately judge where students are in the learning process.  With the games requested cover all subject areas so students will be doing less paper pencil activities (going green) and having fun with learning which will increase motivation, and participation.   \n\nThe small group environment provides a safe place for students to try out new ideas and feel free to take risks.  Working in small groups to solve the problems presented in these games allow children to develop their problem solving abilities in a fun way.  By using the cross curricular games requested, students will be able to participate in this type of learning environment. \n\nYour help will make learning fun for my students, thus making it possible for my students to reach their goal of becoming life long learners, and responsible, independent citizens.","f"
"ffff2d9c769c8fb5335e949c615425eb","Have you ever had to crowd around an iPad screen to access information? Students are patient with each other, but patience is just not enough when you want to get an assignment completed. Ideally, all students should have an iPad. Considering my budget, it's a dream . I respectfully request 1 iPad. \n\nMy students attend a K-6 public school in Idaho. They attend intervention to assist them with extra academic support. Their ages range from eight to twelve. These students desperately want to ""catch up"" to their peers, and the approximately twenty-five kids work hard everyday in my class to achieve this goal.  These across grade students are divided into four different sessions by their academic strengths and weaknesses. Literally, all of these children beg to use my personal iPad to access information or use it as an educational tool. I have a schedule for usage because that is the only way I can find a fair avenue to ensure students get exposure to this ideal learning tool. If I had one more iPad to schedule into the day, students could experience this ultimate invention that motivates and engages children more than once a week. There are thousands of applications that will allow students to learn concepts in all areas of our curriculum. Intervention would be even more enriched. \n\nI integrate all areas of our curriculum into reading, writing, speaking, listening and math concepts. For example, if we are studying geometry I will have pairs of students take my iPad and take pictures of angles outdoors where they might see angles in nature or man-made materials.They return and orally record their findings on the iPad, along with their pictures, and present to the class the following day.This process takes a long time for all six in the class to complete, because we only have one iPad.  Many times they are crowded around the iPad to acquire the information they need/want simply because the device is so engaging and concise about the topic. I particularly remember observing them shoulder-to-shoulder watching an animated rap about figurative language. They were crowded, but laughing and grasping the concept far more than by filling out a worksheet. After the viewing they wrote their own very creative rap about metaphors and similes. They were motivated! \n\nEducation is experiencing an exciting shift where we teach depth of knowledge of a subject rather than skim the service of a topic. The new Common Core State Standards have set the bar high for learning. With these high standards a new approach to teaching rich content is critical to engage and motivate students. Technology will be key when addressing these rigorous standards, especially with students who need an extra push. I will use an iPad in my classroom very thoughtfully and responsibly. ","t"
"fffeebf4827d745aa36b17c2d38d1966","The rewards of playing a musical instrument is great.  Access to flutes and percussion supplies are in demand in our school music program. Funding is becoming more limited with the current economical environment. \n\nOur school has great kids that love to learn and have fun.  As a Title 1 school, many of our students lack the necessary funds to supply an instrument.  The school provides as many as possible.  Our supply of flutes is very low and adding another would give one more student the opportunity to play in the ensemble.   \n\nBy adding a flute, we will have four flutes for check out.  This will allow one more student a year to choose the flute as their instrument.  The student will develop self-confidence, multitasking ability, setting and reaching goals, self-confidence, and pride.  Percussion supplies will allow us to enrich our music with a broader range of percussive sounds. All percussion items are part of a standard band set-up.   \n\nI believe music is an important part of a well balanced education. I believe every student should be able to participate although they may have financial need.  The more students that have access to music the better for them and our community. ","f"
"fffee68353ade53e7692b23098096683","My students enjoy hearing stories and this Tag reader will allow them to enjoy listening, while reading along. \nI have an eager group of kindergarten students who love coming to school to learn. Many of the students are Second Language Learners with little or no English spoken at home. The majority of our school is on free and reduced lunch. Many of the students do not have technology at home and these readers will be a great exposure to learning through the use of technology. The Tag Readers will be a great way for students to work with their families to increase their English skills. \n \n\nI teach 5-K in a very rural South Carolina community. The school has a 93% Free/Reduced Lunch ratio and is also known as a school in the ""Corridor of Shame"". \nThis school year we have faced drastic budget cuts. There is no money for anything ""extra"".  I really feel that this class would thrive with adequate beginning books and the Tag Reader from Leapfrog. I would use these materials as a center activity that the students could enjoy. \n \n\nThese Tag readers will allow my students to be actively engaged in their reading during center time. Right now, for our listening center, we use computers. By adding the Tag readers, students will be able to find a comfortable spot in which to read. The Tag readers will also be a good example of a reader for my struggling readers. They will be able to work on their reading, phonics, and phonemic awareness in a fun way which I hope will help motivate them to want to become even better readers. \n \n\nIf our classroom were to get these Tag readers, they would help all of my students with their fluency and decoding skills. They will especially help my struggling readers because the more examples of good readers that they hear, the more likely they are to be motivated to try and be a better reader. These Tag readers would be another example of a good reader. They also provide learning in a fun way which is always the best way to learn. \n ","f"
"fffec078a2249c2365f3086a6eac7e4a","My full-day Kindergarten class is over 50% English language learners as well as being eligible for free or reduced lunch.  The district uses immersion for Kindergarten as the method for building English proficiency.  Many of the students struggle with phonemic awareness and comprehension.  They also lack the resources to build their literacy at home, and I wish to address that issue with my proposal for donor funds.\n\nBecause of their lack of English language proficiency, the caregivers of my students do not read to them on a daily basis and often have their own difficulty understanding notes and flyers sent home. My proposal is to use the funds to purchase books, audio tapes, cassette players and backpacks for these students to take home on weekends.  They would then be told to listen to the stories with their families, fill in a response form which would be written in English as well as their native language, and then return the resources on Monday.  To further build the literacy component, the students would be asked to share with the class their response form.\n\nListening to a story and reading along with the text is a proven benefit to English language learners.  It builds confidence as the children hear the words pronounced correctly and practiced at home.  The families benefit from spending time together as well as hearing English spoken correctly.\n\nOther benefits of the program include encouraging shared literacy experiences with the families, building vocabulary, listening skills, phonemic awareness, and comprehension as well as building self esteem in beginning readers.  Research has proven that early literacy experiences are essential for future academic achievement.","f"

Help them fall in love with books! \n\nOur school is a charter on the south side of Chicago that focuses on social-emotional learning.  My students receive instruction in smaller, more structured special education classes due to their reading deficiencies. They want to be able to read like their non-disabled peers but many of them have given up on school and are not engaged in their classwork. I would love to provide them with high interest novels to get them re-invested in their learning and help them grow both as readers and as individuals.   \n\nOrca Soundings are teen fiction for reluctant readers. We will use Orca Soundings in leveled small group literature circles. Students will progress through the levels as they strengthen their reading comprehension and fluency. Our literature circles will be a combination of discussion based activities and comprehension checks, and will make students feel safe in their reading abilities in front of their peers.   \n\nFunding this project will make such a difference in the lives of my students because you will be providing them with novels that they won't want to put down and creating ravenous readers for life!

The students in my class need opportunities to develop letter knowledge while learning to read independently.  \n\nAt the beginning of first grade we review letter and sound correspondence and the students are challenged to begin reading independently. At-risk readers who might be intimidated by other books often find alphabet books appealing. Alphabet books help the children review and practice their letter knowledge while also helping them comfortably make the transition to reading independently.  \n\nAlphabet books support literacy development by providing opportunities for developing oral language, learning letter sequence, associating a sound with a letter name and shape, and building vocabulary and world knowledge. Please support literacy development by funding ABC Read.  ","f"

With the digital cameras, the students would be able to create visual representations of what we are learning and be able to represent it in a different manner. \n\nI have tons of ideas of how we would be able to use the cameras to deepen our understanding and enhance our learning. A good example of this would be when we are learning about animals. We will have live African bullfrogs that we will be observing and recording our observations over time. It would great if the students were able to use a camera to have a visual observation to record as well. They would be able to look at the pictures and see if there was any changes and make further observations about the animals. Along with our animal unit, we go to the zoo. The students would be able to use the cameras to take pictures of the animals they saw and discuss their adaptations with each other.\n\nThe possibilities of the cameras are endless.

They love this music program and the many opportunities that they receive through music education at this school, including choir and instrumental ensemble. We are in need of some instruments, however, and our growing population makes the need more intense. Our students sing beautifully, and are learning to accompany themselves on instruments. The purchase of this glockenspiel will be very important to them, and will reward their diligence with the beauty of a balanced instrumental accompaniment. \n\nStudents learn so much through our work with instrumental ensemble music. They learn ensemble skills, how to listen thoughtfully to themselves and others, how to understand notation, how to listen for balance between the voice and the instrument, how to work cooperatively in a group, how to be sensitive to the quality of music. It is simply a priceless experience and challenges the mind while building emotional depth. \n\nI am most hopeful that this project will be supported because this equipment will be used and appreciated for many years to come, and will be a valued part of our music education program.

These young children struggle in the area of reading, particularly fluency and comprehension.\n\nUpgrading our listening center by adding individual cassette players and replacing our broken tape recorder will give my students greater opportunities to hear what fluent reading sounds like, to mimic it, to  enhance their vocabulary skills, and to practice basic reading comprehension skills. \n\nAnother benefit of having the individual cassette players is the power of providing differentiated instruction in the listening center. One tape player with 6 headphones while helpful, poses the limitation of six students listening to the same story.  I may have six students that are on the same reading level but they may not need to practice the same skill.  The addition of the individual cassette players will allow students to read/listen individually at their own pace with tailor made lessons.\n\nReading is the basis of all academic success.

"fffdf9d286e715165b60674ac9d05c6c","Did you know that an estimated 32% of teens report that they have been targets of online bullying? The American Academy of Pediatrics calls cyber bullying ""the most common online risk for all teens.""  \n\nBullying is not a new problem. While bullying has long been an issue among teens, the use of computers and smart phones to send rumors or post cruel messages has made it possible for bullying to extend beyond the school yard and reach students in the safety of their own homes. Even though physical injuries may not be present, cyber bullying leaves deep emotional scars on the victim. \n\nCyber bullied students may appear sad, moody, or anxious; may avoid coming to school; withdraw from social activities; experience a drop in grades; or fear using a computer. In extreme cases, online bullying can drive a child or teen to deep depression and even suicide. Since 1983, over 150 teen suicides have been linked, in part, to the pressure of cyber bullying. \n\nI am the media specialist in a rural, Title I K-12 school in Alabama. Many of the discipline problems our teachers and administrators face are a result of something that started on Facebook or Twitter the night before. \n \n\nWe are looking at this severe problem within our school and taking steps to educate our students on this issue. One excellent tool that we would like to utilize is the Teen Cybersmarts Program. Teen Cybersmarts is an interactive eBook program which simulates a real-life Internet experience within the safety of an instructional, guided, and fun platform. The goal of Teen Cybersmarts is to ""create savvy cyber-citizens who don't fear the Internet, but can make informed and sophisticated decisions every time they sign on."" Teen Cybersmarts shows users how to deal with online bullying, including how to respond to or ignore a bully and where to turn for help. To implement this program, we must have an eBook Reader. We are asking you to consider a donation toward an Apple iPad so that we may project our online program onto our whiteboard for whole-class discussion.  \n\nIn an era where so much of our communication exists online, it is easy for teens to feel invulnerable and forget the risks associated with interacting online. Thank you so much for considering our project. In a time where education funding has been on the chopping block, it is only because of generous donors like you that my students have the tools they need to succeed. Donors Choose has made such a difference in my classroom. Thank you for believing in my students as much as I do. ","f"

My students are, for the most part, typical inner city children with little experience of the world outside their own neighborhood.  Many are underprivileged and classed as ""at risk"" students.  We serve a student population that is changing rapidly.  Our current student population is approximately 70% African American and 30% Hispanic. Many students are the first in their family that have the opportunity to  attend college. Our students are eager to learn, work hard, and consistently score well on state exams. \n\nAs stated, many of my students have little concept or experience of the world outside their neighborhood.  In allowing them easier access to explore such interactive sites as Google Earth, the Smithsonian, the British Museum, I  forsee an increase in knowledge of our own and other cultures.  Recently, as a class, we accessed the Egyptian Room in the British Museum and the students were fascinated and eager to learn more, but with our limited technology resources we could not explore further.   Tablets would allow our student to really explore the entire world. \n\nGiving students the opportunity to understand their own history and culture and the history and cultures of other lands is important in today's increasingly global society.  In giving students access to technology, it will give them the ability to explore the boundaries of the world  in which we live and make them more rounded and knowleagable students. ","f"

My students need to develop better communication skills and become comfortable with seeing themselves in digital video. \n\nMy students come from a high poverty area, however, they attend a magnet school for the arts.  The arts are a great way for them to learn how to focus their attention and learn bodily control.  They attend a special area for dance, drama, and can sign up for a weekly strings class.  Even in the primary grades, there is a push for stage presence and performance, so what better way to have them adapt to seeing themselves than to use a video camera?  My students are very urban and love watching television shows like Hannah Montana and I-Carly, where they see how technology is used to promote a specific ""look.""  Watching themselves on television will help them develop how they appear to others. \n\nI am requesting a Sony Digital Camera that will allow me to take digital recordings of my students.  I want to use the camera to document their first day of school by conducting short interviews about how they are feeling and what they want to learn in the school year.  The camera will also be used to record small group discussions about a book in which each person is given a specific role to play.  I also want to use the camera as a means of communication to another class in Japan that we will be writing letters to throughout the year.  The equipment I am requesting would allow us to broadcast via Internet.  Lastly, I want to use the camera to record group activities in which my students are presenting a project or idea.  All of these activities will give us instant feedback that we can review for assessment in our communication skills. \n\nAs my young students become aware of their surroundings, they will learn how they appear to others.  Communication is important, whether in a small or large group, and my students need to learn how to take turns and use positive body language.  Are they giving everyone in their group a turn?  Are they speaking too softly or loudly?  Are they making eye contact with each other and paying attention to the leader?  A video camera can help assess in all of these areas. ","f"
"fffcfa4388e8ac482c44734bffa891c8","I wish someone would have taught me how to manage my money, save for a big purchase or shop for a bargain when I was 9 years old. Getting a head start in financial literacy may have saved me a lot of interest payments as I navigated my way through adult money matters. \n\nI will be working with a very bright, motivated and curious class in the fall. With their motivation and curiosity naturally comes an independent spirit, and the need to express themselves. Those independent expressions often come at inappropriate times, such as when walking though the hallways, on a fire drill or during quiet, independent work time. Rather than discouraging their self expression, I would like to help them channel it into class appropriate creativity, as well as learn how to self monitor for correct, appropriate behaviors. \n\nI am designing a system for classroom rewards, based on a financial literacy theme. My idea is to ""pay"" the students in ""GOOD"" money for positive behaviors or classroom achievements. Many teachers use stars or stickers to recognize these appropriate behaviors. I will use the color printer to create the ""GOOD"" dollars, which they earn for various behaviors. I will also work with them to create various store posters, such as a shopping list, a price list and leaderboard, to track their savings, wish lists and progress. We will display these on the new corkboard. The items such as stickers, crayons and paints will be our inventory. They will be able to save their money for a larger purchase (such as the glitter pens) or use their money sooner for a smaller purchase (like a single Smencil). They will also be subject to having to pay a fine for repeated inappropriate behavior, whereas they may lose part of their savings. \n\nMost people learn life skills by being immersed in them. I am planning on teaching my students financial literacy and appropriate behaviors by immersing them in it each and everyday. By using a motivating, colorful and interesting technique combining positive behavior reinforcement and taking responsibility for their own actions, I know that they will learn to be good savers, be financially literate and continue to work towards being good school citizens.

"fffcab52aff6aec5843afafe919d4a06","The more a child reads, the better he will be at reading. It is that simple, but harder to carry out than you think. Especially for children who come from homes without books. My students need fantastic books, written for beginning readers.  They need over 100 apiece in their first year of school. \n\nThese kindergarten students attend an urban/suburban Title I school in Virginia. They come from 50 countries and speak a dozen languages. Many are eligible for free or reduced lunches and come from homes where reading isn't a common activity. Many of their parents don't speak English; some are illiterate. These five-year-olds often haven't attended preschool and start the year ignorant of the alphabet, or how to write their own name. Yet by the end of kindergarten, they have to know how to read and write, or with every passing year they will fall further behind their peers. I am a literacy teacher. My job is to make sure they know how to read and write by June. One of the ways I do this is to expose them to as many wonderful books as possible so that they will not only know how to read, they will love to read. \n\nImagine a room of 5 year olds sitting or lying on the floor, filling the room with a quiet buzz, whispering words to themselves or each other. Beside each is a box of books they've chosen to read and reread this week. The critical element in this picture is the books, 160 of them at a minimum of 8 per child. Multiply that number and you get the idea how many books are needed to keep these children motivated and learning. Buying high quality books costs more money than kindergarten teachers can be expected to spend. Although we work in a generous school district, the budget does not include books for independent reading. The 8 sets of leveled books I am requesting are full of colorful pictures, fun characters, and great details. They include stories or facts, written in simple language early readers can read independently. Although these books are little, they are expensive. Helping a child become a skillful reader early on is worth every penny. \n\nKindergarten no longer is a time to play dress up or color pictures.  Today's students have to learn to read, write and do math. If they fall behind in kindergarten, they will already be struggling readers in first grade, and probably in the years to come. Help my kindergartners stay on track and feel good about themselves as learners with great books they will love. If we can catch them early, we will have helped them for life. ","f"

Most families fall below the poverty line. Some of our families live with other families. We have one family that rents the dining room of an apartment because that is all they can afford. Despite their life trials, we teach beautiful and happy children. They appreciate everything. Most of them are learning English, while learning the curriculum. They attend a 100 year old school (overcrowded, as well) that lacks many of the modern bells and whistles that you find in today's newly constructed educational facilities.\n\nThe staff goes above and beyond to help our students and their families. We have become seasoned in using resources, such as donorschoose.org, to provide for our students. We spend a great deal of personal time trying to accommodate our families with basic needs, such as food, clothing, coats, etc. Sometimes we forget the simplest things children need: like crayons, art, and creativity. \n\nMy high school-aged son is collecting used and broken crayons, and crayon bits, that would normally be trashed. He bought different molds and plans to melt the crayons to create new crayons for our younger students. He has spent much time collecting, sorting and unwrapping the crayons. Once melted, the old crayons will be poured into molds to give them new life. In addition to fun shaped crayons, my son plans on making kaleidoscope crayons, too. We are requesting pencil cases to hold these crayons so they can be distributed in nice packaging. I also am requesting iron-on transfers so we can make a label for these cases. The crayons will be distributed to Kindergarten students in the school where I teach.\n\nMy son hopes that providing these fun crayons will help feed a hunger in young creative souls. It will provide these children with something fun to do, at playtime, since it is so dangerous outside their homes and our school doors in this community. \n\nThe students will be able to reconnect with some of the cultural vibrancy they left in their native countries.

Their community was economically depressed long before the current economic downturn that is currently facing our country and will likely continue to be economically depressed after the county recovers from the current recession. Over 90% of students at our school receive free or reduced lunch. That being said, my students see our school as a gem in their community and come to school each day as scholars who believe that they are capable of accomplishing anything. We were 1 of 2 schools in our very large district to substantially raise our test scores on 2010-2011 state test. We are not a school community with a lot of economic resources, but we do a lot with what we have. I have made it my mission to bring as many excellent resources and experiences to my students as possible with the goal of making their educational experience as rich as possible. \n\nLast year I had great results with using Zinn's book in combination with other U.S and California history books as the bulk of my reading and social studies programs.

I saw my students forming an understanding of themes in U.S. history that they could not get from a textbook. I also saw real growth in their ability to read, discuss and understand a nonfiction texts. As importantly, several students who previously had no interest in history at all, began to see themselves as historians and to love history. \n\nIf I am unable to get a class set of these books through donations, I will not be able to use this book this year, because we don't have a reliable photocopier at our school.

These students, like all children, have a thirst for learning, and are capable of doing big things. Unfortunately they come to me ill prepared and underexposed.

Since we only have 6 cookie pans and a small bin of letters I can only allow a small group of students to use them at a time. I would like to do whole-group instruction with the magnetic letters and white boards. My students are in the process of learning letters sounds and are starting to read short words, so these materials can help me scaffold their learning. The magnetic white boards, easel, and magnetic letters that you would provide for my students would assist them in various categories of language arts. \n\nKindergartners have a short attention span and with your help my students would be captivated in their learning! Hands-on learning allows children to retain the material, and in this case letter recognition and letter sounds are a crucial component that needs to be mastered in order for students to be able to read. You would be helping me build a strong literacy foundation for my 24 kindergarten students! ","f"

But like most middle school students, they desperately want to be involved and included with their same-aged peers. They come from many districts within our county and spend their day at SEMS. Our 8 to 11 students engage in a largely functional curriculum focused on preparing them for semi-independent life in the community. \n\nWe are living in a golden era of technology. It's cheap, reliable, and very affordable. The ability to type and spell is giving way to the simple abilities to talk and touch. It's so elemental, so intrinsic, and we need to give our students this kind of resource. Unfortunately, our funding and even our salaries have been frozen so we've been unable to get any new technology for over 7 years. With devices like the iPod Touch our students can communicate with voice, video, and pictures. Those with speech delays can use assistive communication software. Special academic needs can be targeted with literally thousands of educational applications. Touch-based devices are the future for our students and we very much want to get at least 2 for our classroom. This is our start. \n\nOur students have a better chance than ever to participate in their local communities with limited support. Touch-based devices are going to be the key. By talking and touching they can find their way to work and home, talk with friends, take photo reminders, and even communicate with others.

Students are only capable of expanding their minds as far as the resources available allow them.\n\nBringing a classroom set of Bloody Times into our classroom will allow my children to experience what life was like during the Civil War era and the after-shock Lincoln's assassination had on the country. This story brings to life two epic events of the Civil War era: the thrilling chase to apprehend Confederate president Jefferson Davis in the wake of the Lincoln assassination and the momentous  20 -day funeral that took Abraham Lincoln's body home to Springfield. \n \n\nThe importance of this project is two-fold.  It not only shows and tells the story of what happened after Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, it also provides closure to the entire saga that my students lived through while reading Chasing Lincoln's Killer.  This story is full of fascinating twists and turns, and is perfectly illustrated with dozens of rare historical images.  Bloody Times is the perfect sequel to Chasing Lincoln's Killer. ","t"

Many of our teachers are not able to continue to spend significant money, from their own pockets, to buy the supplies they would like their students to have.  Our students have tremendous potential and without the enrichment experiences their full potential may never surface.\n \n\nI want my students to have as many upper level challenging activities as possible. Math, English and Reading are subjects that take priority, due to state testing.  My wish is to foster a love of Science. One way I can begin this challenge is to offer a unit of study on animal organ dissection.  Through hands-on learning each student will have the opportunity to dissect.  The students will learn the components and function of this organ.  Through discovery learning each student will have be the opportunity to be the Science Investigator.   \n\nThis project is very important to my gifted students because there is no better way to learn science than to take part in an investigation.  My students have a extremely high degree of curiosity and incredible desire to want to know how things work, this activity will 100% address their needs.

I would like to  now use technology to offer more immediate and personal teacher feedback. One of the most effective forms of feedback is the writing conference. But often times the full potential of the conference is not realized for lack of a clear record that the student can refer to during revision. This year I plan to record biweekly conferences on student writing using the app, Explain Everything. It will be like a student's own personal Khan Academy. These conferences will be stored in the students' digital portfolio.

I receive $100.00 per year for classroom materials. About 53% of our school receives free lunch so parents really can't afford to help with items this large. Will you please help us make our class library not so much of a disaster?","f"

My students come in every day and they have a desire to learn. They come in each day eager to expand their understanding of the world around them. They either have experienced being picked on or seen others being picked on. I want my students to learn now that bullying or being picked on is not okay! This is the time in their lives when they know it is wrong and we need to educate what they should be doing to help others. \n\nI have selected several books to help educate my students: Bullying in Schools, Confessions of a Former Bully, Wilma Jean - the Worry Machine, Recess Queen, One, Zero and Spaghetti in a Hot Dog Bun. My goal around this project is to read each of these books, discuss the way the characters feel, what happens and how bullying could have been prevented. Then after in writing, I want to have students begin brainstorming a book about bullying. I want them to write their book and illustrate it. After, my students will share these stories with their reading buddies who are in second grade. So, two classes will benefit from their project. By having my students apply what they know into writing their own books, it will make the purpose stick more and emphasize the importance of being role model citizens. \n\nWhat would our education look like if we didn't teach students the importance of being role model students, not to bully or pick on others and to get help when they see something that is not okay?

They've planned future traveling plans, designed their dream homes, and have become celebrated community heroes.\n\nThe classroom is a safe haven where dreaming high is encouraged. Nothing is impossible when they dream, write, and share their future plans. They would thrive as enthusiastic learners if they are provided with the memories that will last a lifetime. They are enthusiastic learners because they are provided with the hands-on experiences and activities that at home are simply unattainable. \n\nIn today's classroom, teachers require so much from their students in Language Arts, Math, and Science. However, physical fitness, art, & health; though they are part of a well planned curriculum, they take a back seat. It's not until our students reach 5th grade that we see the need for physical fitness. Fifth Graders are required to take a physical exam. By then most of the students that are overweight could have benefited from direct instruction in health and nutrition. Teachers make the most impact when the students are in the lower grades. They are like little sponges that learn and do what is asked of them. This is the reason, I have requested material that will instruct my students directly in nutrition, physical fitness, and healthy habits.

My students' main recreational activities revolve around television sets and video games. Because of this passive entertainment, they have yet to discover that they can play an active roll in creating a dynamic, creative, and meaningful world for themselves. \n\nFor many years in a row now, I have surprised my students with a black light painting party. They are greeted at the door with wacky, day-glow costumes. When they walk into the dark classroom their jaws drop. As painting instructions are called out they lose themselves in the experience. As the day progresses, more and more murals are created until every surface of the room is completely covered. They drag their friends over during break and lunch to show them what they created. \n\nThis lesson was inspired by the artist Keith Haring who was an incredible activist. He created art for the people and made sure it was accessible to everyone, not just people who pay to go to galleries. Many of his works incorporated children working on large pieces together. His large, childlike, playful pieces have delighted millions. \n\nMy students leave this project full of excitement about getting involved in community projects. They become leaders and organizers.

Our school has a focus on incorporating technology into the classroom and the lessons, but lacks the budget with which to do so. The students come from families whose incomes rarely allow for newer technologies in the students' home lives, so there is a bit of a predicament in meeting the school's focus.  \n\nClassically, mathematics is the class in which students have the least motivation. A skilled teacher will incorporate many hands-on, interactive activities, but there are some days where a lecture simply cannot be avoided.

As I already have an interactive whiteboard set up, having a way for the students to interact with it will get them excited for the class, if for no other reason than getting to use the cool technology.

These books will be used by my 28 ESOL students in the weekly reading hour, and by the entire school during the Readathon. In both situations, students will be able to choose from these engaging books and read at their own pace and level. \n\nAs I read through the list of Newberry and Caldecott Medal books, I recognize many of the names and remember them from my youth. These books are identified because they are the most engaging and memorable, exactly what my English language learners need to not only complete 35 books during this school year, but to develop a lifelong appreciation of reading.\n\nThis proposal contains about a fifth of the Newberry and Caldecott Medal winners including Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze by Elizabeth Lewis, Shen of the Sea by Arthur Bowie Chrisman, The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle by Hugh Lofting, and Make Way for Ducklings by Robert McCloskey.\n\nThank you for supporting my students by giving them access to engaging literature.","f"

Special needs students will find many more things that they can do through the help of technology in our classroom. \n\nMy students deal with  many different types of  disabilities which include ADHD, vision, autism, anxiety disorders, and learning disabilities. They are courageous, strong warriors who everyday come to school and try to learn.  Some come from a low income environment. In our schools special needs setting we work with all grades, kindergarten to sixth grade.  Each student  has an individual program to support their disability in order for them to access the regular curriculum. \n\nIf we are able to get a donation of two iPads for our classroom, endless opportunities would open up for the students.  With the wide range of apps that are now available my students will be able to access learning materials and games that will help to develop reading, math, listening skills and comprehension that they need to master grade level concepts. The engaging graphics and and easy finger touch use, will help to focus their attention.  \n\nBrain research shows that the more pathways we use to input information into the brain, greatly increase the students ability to retain that information  They will have access to audio books, picture books, and core curriculum materials with the use of the iPads.   Technology in the classroom is the future of education and my students need all the extra help that I can offer to keep them engaged in learning this year. \n\nThank you for considering a donation to this project. My goal in this endeavor would be to increase the students ability to access a wider range of programs that match their learning style needs.  Courageous warriors are never afraid to take  difficult steps toward a better future and with your support the journey will be easier for my students.  Please, help us step towards a brighter future this year. ","f"
"fff6df6b3cba00f54a7d64492c97f847","Hello! I am a fifth and sixth grade bilingual teacher at I.S. 125 in the Bronx. Approximately 95% of the students in my school qualify for reduced or free lunch.  100% of my students receive free lunch. My class this year will be comprised of about 28 English language learning/bilingual students most of whose families have immigrated to the United States in search of a better life for their families.  Because of their familial and economic circumstances and the efforts their families have made to be in this country, my students are constantly eager to learn and advance in their studies.  Unfortunately the lack of special attention and tools for learning available to my students often makes it difficult to take full advantage of my students' drive and perseverance. \n\nI am incredibly dedicated and passionate about my work and constantly search above and beyond for tools and resources so that my students have an equal opportunity to an excellent education and an excellent future. Last year, I encountered several challenges as a first year bilingual teacher because of the severe lack of resources available to my students as native Spanish speakers.  Despite these conditions, my students achieved more than anyone could've imagined and felt proud of what they had proven to themselves.  This year, I want to make sure my students have ALL they need to be academically successful both by their own measurement and by the measurement of State and local education.  I do not want my students to be denied their right to an excellent and equal education.\n\nAs we all know, reading is perhaps the most important component of any learners life.  Specifically, in the lives of my bilingual students, reading is more than just a part of school - it means having true exposure to the world of reading for the first time, learning a new language, developing and sustaining a first language and often - learning how to read all together.  Many of my students have low reading skills (if any at all) due to the hardships and life experiences that kept them away from academia in their home countries. Learning to read for my students means more than just taking a standardized test.  It means learning why reading is important, its significant role in learning a second language and the beauty of sustaining and developing their first.  \n\nThis summer I took Lucy Calkins' ""The Art of Teaching Reading"" as a Columbia University Teacher's College graduate student. In this course I was taught and trained the principals of one of the top and internationally renowned reading and writing projects in the field.  This proposal is one of nine all linked to implementing Lucy Calkins' Reading Workshop in my classroom next year (and for years to come in my work with bilingual students). The fundamental thought of this program is to teach students HOW to read, WHY to read and to create life-long learners and readers.  Reader's workshop takes place every day for a minimum of 50- 70 minutes of the day and utilizes coursework across all subject areas to boost and build the students as readers.  In this program, the teacher is not the ""lecturer"" in front of the classroom but a coach that guides the team and each individual player towards their best.  I provide the readers with the tools to think critically, read critically and assess critically all while enjoying reading. In order to do this students need to have access to a large quantity (at least 15 books per student) and a wide array (all genres) of literature.  This proposal specifically requests all sorts of author study books (including E.B. White, Paula Fox, Lois Lowry, and Cynthia Voight) in Spanish. It is one of 9 other proposals that together can make this project a reality in my classroom.  Other proposals linked to this same project request donations of books in other genres (and also break up the total cost into parts). \n\nUnfortunately, without Donorschoose and people like you, this project would be virtually impossible. Thank you so much for helping me help my students live up to their dreams. Funding this proposal will be an important start to providing my students with an equal chance in education and in life. \n\nThe cost of the books, ranging from E.B. White's ""Las telaranas de Carlota"" to Lowis Lowry's ""Anastasio Tiene Problemas"", is $332, including shipping and disposable camera. ","f"

Teaching kids is a very fulfilling career. \n\nThe only thing I wish I could have with my job is money to spend on my classroom- how nice if teachers got money from their school each year to spend on resources to enhance their teaching. My school has VERY little material to do labs and their models (if any!) are old and worn out from abuse over the years. I have been fortunate to get models from Donors Choose that I keep in my storage room and monitor so that they stay in good shape through the years. But I need a few more models, a flexible knee joint that shows how ligaments connect bones to muscle, and two ear models. I also need yeast for a lab I want to do which compares the amount of sugar in different drinks. \n\nHow great if I could have these supplies to enhance my upcoming lessons next semester. My students will be further engaged and their curiosity stimulated. \n\nYour donation will help make it possible for my students to have a more hands-on-type of learning in their science education, something I feel is so important.

Therefore, I have to challenging and educational games to improve their reading comprehension skills. \n\n      These reading comprehension activity centers are going to be used for small group intervention.

Students can write their answers on a dry erase board graphic organizers after reading illustrated stories.  With several centers to chose from, students will unlikely get bored because of consistent repetition.

I would like to provide them with a wide variety of puzzles to keep their interest. Puzzles are such a great way for five and six year olds to strengthen these skills. \n\nI teach in a high poverty elementary school in the upstate of South Carolina. The majority of my students had never gone to a preschool program or daycare so this was their first experience in school. After the first few weeks the nerves began to calm, my students began opening up and have made leaps and bounds in more ways than one. We are a very diverse group of individuals that function as a tight knit family. \n\nWe borrowed puzzles from another teacher and my students showed great abilities in working puzzles. They gained social skills by wanting to work together and also helping out friends who could not build a puzzle on their own. I did not realize how much building puzzles affects my students for the better. I'm excited to see how they will grow with these materials. \n\nThese puzzles will impact most of my students because they come from homes that cannot provide puzzles, school is where they can explore them. The puzzles provide the students with a higher process of thinking and strategies on how to put the pieces together. My students would love to have puzzles in their own classroom to build. ","f"

This proposal is requesting a donation for another economically disadvantaged student in my 8th (and 9th) grade French class. This student has worked hard for two years, has written pen pal letters to friends in Liege, Belgium and has video-conferenced with international friends last November. This student is motivated to learn about a new culture, practice a new language and learn about himself in the process. He will discover that there are different ways of greeting each other, of celebrating special holidays, of showing respect in school and so much more. He will learn that different does not mean less valuable or important and that stereotyping is a demeaning process.  He/she will also learn firsthand that there are multiple perspectives and many challenges facing globalization in our world. \n\nFive students do not have the funds to pay for this trip. This proposal requests $1,643 for one student to travel to Paris for three nights followed by five nights in Liege, Belgium with pen pal families March 25-April 3, 2006. Our Belgian friends will come back to Chapel Hill with us and spend 8-10 days in our homes.This will be an opportunity for rich dialogue and cemented international friendships.\n\nParents and students are working concessions at basketball and volleyball games to fund our economically-disadvantaged students.  If even one child is funded, that would be a tremendous help as we will work hard to the last day to get all students on the plane with us. \n\nFunding one of these students will have a direct impact on how this young lady,gentleman will see the world: full of hope and possibility, perhaps even a vision of himself as a future ambassador.

"fff5fd6f1a382a7a9ceff838f35212e1","College professors and high school teachers observe that students consistently have trouble reading nonfiction texts. The solution can be found in elementary school. Indeed, it begins in kindergarten. \n\nI teach kindergarten and first grade (I stay with the students for two years) at an urban elementary school. About 90% of the students are low-income, and 90% are English language learners. Most have not been to preschool, so I am their first exposure to formal education. \n\nMy students are ravenous readers. I meet with each student several times a week for small group reading instruction. In each small group meeting, students learn to read real books, not textbooks, and keep a book in their personal collection to practice over the next few weeks.\n \nThe problem is that nearly all of the books in my classroom library are fiction. My students get very little practice reading and discussing nonfiction. Because of lack of practice, my students have difficulty anticipating what they will learn, distinguishing between main ideas and supporting details, and summarizing what they have read. Thinking through nonfiction text isn't harder than fiction, simply different.\n \nThe nonfiction book sets requested will allow my students ample practice to read and discuss nonfiction texts. They will be increasing their science content knowledge while learning how to approach, read, and discuss nonfiction. \n\nLearning how to read and discuss nonfiction isn't a mystery. It takes practice. Students need to start reading nonfiction early on and read it often. This is also how one learns to enjoy reading nonfiction and conducting research. Creating the next generation of scientists starts with nonfiction books in kindergarten. ","f"
